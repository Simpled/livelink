# livelink

A simple file syncing script that generates symbolic links of files and folders, allowing them to be synced to Dropbox and the like.

## Usage

Create a `livelink.yml` file in the directory in which you'd like to create your symbolic links. We call this the sync directory. Then run:

```
node livelink
```

The script will ask you for the path to your sync folder. Just follow the prompts.
